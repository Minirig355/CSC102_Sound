"# CSC102 - AUDIO

The two sound files are located on the 'Games' tab and are played when you roll the dice. The first file will play generally when you roll the dice and the second sound file will take over and play a snake eyes specific sound if you roll snake eyes (1/36 chance).

The game.js file is the one with changes made, specifically lines 15, 16 and 59-63. They're commented appropriately.
